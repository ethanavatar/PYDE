# PYDE
An IDE made using PyQt5

### Currently
  * Its just a `PlainTextEdit` with no external functionallity like new, open, save, etc.
  * And an empty `TreeWidget`
### TODO
  * Get the whole file menu functioning to make it more than just a notepad.
  * Have the `TreeWidget` list the structure of  a chosen directory (preferably through `open folder` in the file menu).
  * syntax highlighting
  * glorious dark mode
