# PYDE
An IDE made using PyQt5

### Currently
  * Now has all fuctions like a normal text editor; new, open, save, etc.
  * Removed `dirtree` because i needed to focus on the core features of a text editor
   * Same with dark mode

### TODO
  * syntax highlighting (less important)
  * Edit menu functions; undo, redo, copy, cut, paste, etc

### Installation & Use
Just make sure you already have PyQt5 installed by doing :

`python3 -m pip install pyqt5 --user`

**NOTE : This does not work with PySide2 Bindings**
 
Using it is as simple as running the main module with `python3 main.py`
