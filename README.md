# PYDE
An IDE made using PyQt5

### Currently
  * Now has all fuctions like a normal text editor; new, open, save, etc.
  * `DirTree` now shows a treeview of the working directory (which is stuck at root currently)
  * Dark mode is default now and you're stuck with it (no way to change it)
### TODO
  * Have the `DirTree` list the structure of  a chosen directory (preferably through `open folder` in the file menu).
  * syntax highlighting
